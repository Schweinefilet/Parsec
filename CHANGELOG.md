# Changelog

## Versioning

`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` — read as **main version . big patch . minor patch**.

- **MAJOR** — a release that changes what the site *is*: a new mode of
  exploring, a redesign, a rewrite people would notice immediately.
- **MINOR** ("big patch") — a substantial feature or a body of work: the time
  control, the ISS tracker, an overhaul of how something is rendered.
- **PATCH** ("minor patch") — fixes, tuning, and small additions that improve
  what is already there without adding a new capability.

Every release is a commit titled with its version. The version in
`frontend/package.json` matches the newest entry here; keep them in step.

## 1.5.5

- **The Voyager tracks are the paths the spacecraft actually flew.** They were
  a straight line from the Sun's direction out to the marker, with the near end
  redrawn every frame from wherever Earth happens to be — so the launch point
  wandered a full orbit each year, as though the mission had set off from a
  different place every few weeks. Both tracks now start where Earth was on
  their launch day in 1977 and stay there.

  In between they follow the trajectory each craft flew, sampled from JPL
  Horizons and baked into `data/voyagerTracks.json`. Every bend in them is a
  real gravity assist. Voyager 2 is the one that did the Grand Tour — Jupiter,
  Saturn, Uranus, Neptune — and Voyager 1 did not: it traded Uranus and Neptune
  for a close pass of Titan at Saturn, which threw it up out of the plane of the
  planets, which is why its track climbs away and never comes back down. The
  test suite checks both halves of that: each craft passes within a planet's own
  drawn radius of every planet it used, and Voyager 1 stays over 100 units clear
  of the two it didn't.

  The geometry is built once and never rewritten. Scrubbing the clock only
  changes how much of it is drawn, plus the final vertex, which is pinned to
  the marker so the line always ends exactly at the spacecraft.

- **Both Voyagers were sitting 23.4° off the plane they belong to.** The pinned
  state vectors they were placed from were in ecliptic coordinates, which is
  what Horizons returns by default, while the rest of the scene runs on
  astronomy-engine's equatorial ones. Both are three numbers in AU and both
  plot without complaint, so nothing looked broken — the spacecraft were just
  in the wrong direction. Position now comes from the same baked ephemeris as
  the track, in the frame the scene actually uses.

- **One radial scale for the whole scene.** The planets are drawn on fixed
  rings — Earth at 96 units, Neptune at 340 rather than the 30× Earth its real
  distance would ask for — while the probes used their own linear scale, so
  nothing that travelled between the two could be placed consistently in both.
  `sceneRadiusForAU` now derives that compression from the planets themselves
  (a new `au` alongside each `orbitR`), and everything off a ring reads it.
  Voyager 1's marker barely moves; Voyager 2's sits a little further out than
  it did, in correct proportion to Voyager 1 for the first time.

- The tracks are drawn brighter than the orbit rings they cross, where before
  they sat below them. A line with two ends carries nothing you need to look
  at; this one is the shape of the mission.

## 1.5.4

- **The ISS tracker now names the country the station is nearest to**, beside
  the latitude and longitude it already showed, with the distance under it —
  or "Overhead" when the ground point is inside that country or just off its
  coast.

  The obvious way to do this is a reverse-geocoding call, and it does not work:
  the station is over water about seven tenths of the time, and that is exactly
  when the question is worth asking. wheretheiss.at will answer "which country
  is at this coordinate" and returns `"??"` for every point at sea. *Nearest*
  is a different question from *over*, and only the first one usually has an
  answer, so the site carries the land geometry to answer it itself.

  `src/data/landPoints.json` holds 15,840 points sampled from Natural Earth's
  coastlines and country interiors — coastlines because they decide the answer
  from out at sea, interiors so a point in the middle of Kazakhstan reads as
  Kazakhstan overhead rather than a border a few hundred km away. Checked
  against the full-resolution polygons over 250 random points in the station's
  latitude band it names the right country 99% of the time; for points genuinely
  over land it reports them a mean of 39 km away. Near a land border it can name
  the neighbour, which is why the readout says "Overhead" rather than a
  precise-looking small number.

  The table is loaded with a dynamic `import()`, so it is a ~21 KB chunk that
  only the tracker page fetches — the home view is unchanged, and the main
  bundle grew by under 1 KB. `scripts/build-land-points.mjs` regenerates it.

- **The trail is the orbit now, not the ground track.** It was drawn on the
  surface, so it read as a shadow the station cast rather than the path it
  flew, and it ended below the marker instead of meeting it. Each fix now
  carries its altitude and is drawn at it, so the trail runs through space and
  joins the dot exactly, with the drop line showing how far up that is.

  It also keeps an orbit's worth of fixes rather than twenty minutes'. At one
  fix every five seconds that is 1,112 of them for the station's 92.7-minute
  period, so leaving the page open draws a whole circuit instead of a short
  tail. Worth knowing what you are looking at: the globe is drawn in Earth's
  frame, so each pass comes round west of the last one — the Earth turned
  underneath — rather than retracing one closed ring.

- **The station on the globe is a green dot now**, not a little modelled body
  with solar panels. At this globe size it was only a few pixels across, so the
  model read as a speck with an odd outline rather than as a spacecraft — and
  being lit by the same sun as the Earth beneath it, it dimmed to nothing
  whenever the station crossed into night, which is exactly when you are
  looking for it. The dot ignores the scene lights, so it is the same green
  wherever the station is. It keeps the halo that makes it findable against the
  bright day side.

- The drifting starfield backdrop is stashed for now. `StarfieldBg` is still in
  the tree and unchanged; both call sites are commented out and marked
  `STASHED StarfieldBg`, so `grep -rn "STASHED StarfieldBg" src` finds the four
  lines to uncomment.

## 1.5.3

- **The iPhone first load no longer takes minutes.** Two separate causes, both
  of which only really hurt on a phone.

  The object labels were React state rebuilt on every frame: ~18 elements
  reconciled and re-laid-out at 60 Hz, each pass preceded by a
  `getBoundingClientRect()` — a read that forces a synchronous layout. Measured
  on a throttled phone profile, that was 360 forced layouts in six seconds, one
  per frame, for text that had usually moved a fraction of a pixel. A desktop
  absorbs it. A phone does not: the main thread never went idle, so everything
  waiting for a gap between frames — texture decodes, model parsing, every
  `requestIdleCallback` — queued behind it. The labels are now plain DOM nodes
  the render loop moves with a composited `transform`, and React is told only
  when the *set* of labels changes, which is when the focus does. Same
  forced-layout count, measured the same way: zero.

  The other half was payload. Phones were downloading the ISS mesh (2.8 MB) and
  Vesta's (1.9 MB) with the scene, for two objects that are a few pixels across
  from the home view — 7.5 MB in total where the rest of the site needs 2.7 MB.
  Vesta now keeps the painted sphere every other small body gets. A sphere is
  the wrong shape for the ISS, so that model is fetched the moment you fly to
  it instead. Halley's nucleus is small enough to keep everywhere, but it waited
  for no one; it now loads during idle time like the rest.

- **No Milky Way on a phone or tablet held upright.** Phones never had it — a
  full-screen backdrop is the worst case for a mobile GPU's fill rate, and it is
  the one thing you are always looking past. Portrait tablets did. A tall narrow
  window shows a sliver of the map stretched over the full height of the screen,
  so the band that makes it read as the Milky Way sits off the top and bottom
  edges: you paid the fill rate for grey fog. Turn the same tablet sideways and
  it comes back, without a reload. The sphere is built the first time it is
  actually wanted, so a tablet that starts in portrait never downloads the map.

## 1.5.2

- Removed the middle-dot (·) separators from the home-view hint text and the
  time control's readout — "Drag to orbit · Scroll to zoom · Click any object to
  explore" and "1w/s · 30 days ahead" read as comma-joined phrases now.
- Moved the "Explore the catalog" pill down onto the same row as the time
  control, rather than stacked in its own row above it.

## 1.5.1

- Fixed the gap in the telemetry ticker's scroll loop. It duplicated its 7
  cells exactly once and wrapped at half that width — seamless only if one
  copy is at least as wide as the bar, but the bar spans the full viewport
  width on any normal desktop window, far wider than 7 short cells. Past the
  end of the two copies the scrolled window ran into empty track before the
  wrap point arrived, which showed as dead space after the last cell ("Sol
  Wind") until the loop caught back up. The copy count is now measured
  against the container and kept just ahead of what the width needs, on any
  screen from a phone to an ultrawide monitor.

## 1.5.0

- **Imagery for objects the scene cannot place.** 27 of the 70 objects have no
  body in the 3D view — every exoplanet and deep-sky target, the near-Earth
  asteroids, and the spacecraft without a scene position. Their pages showed a
  faded starfield with panels floating over nothing. They now show the curated
  photograph where the planet would have been, or the generated cover art for
  the twelve NASA has no usable image of, with the name and key figures
  flanking it as they do for a planet.
- Scene membership is now read from the scene itself rather than guessed from
  an object's category. The old test called Andromeda "in scene" and then
  focused the camera on nothing.
- The time scrubber is hidden on those pages, where it has nothing to move.

## 1.4.3

- The Voyager tracks now run from Earth rather than the Sun. They launched from
  here, and a line out of the Sun read as if they had been flung from it.
- Lifted the home hints clear of the time control. The control is bottom-left
  and the hints are centred, so on a narrower laptop window they collided.
- On desktop the description and the stats sheet are now independent: focusing
  an object slides the description down and leaves the stats collapsed, and the
  description stays put whether or not you expand them. Reading about an object
  no longer costs you the view of it. Mobile is unchanged — it has one panel,
  and it still opens fully.

## 1.4.2

- Removed the offset caption that appeared under the time control while
  dragging the scrubber. The pill already reads out the same thing.

## 1.4.1

- Scaled the Voyager markers down. They were sized to hold a constant angular
  size, which sounds right but means the world size grows without limit — from
  the default view, over a thousand units out, the halo had grown to rival the
  Sun. The scaling is now capped well under Neptune's radius, so they read as
  markers at any zoom while staying legible when focused.

## 1.4.0

Interstellar probes, a time control, and a rebuild of the rocky surfaces.

- **Time control.** Scrub the whole system through time: six rates from live to
  a year per second in either direction, pause, a ten-year scrubber, and a
  reset. Planets follow the clock; moons switch from their stylised live motion
  to true rates so scrubbing is exact and reversible.
- **Voyager 1 and 2 in the scene**, at their real positions from JPL Horizons
  state vectors, with outbound tracks and screen-constant markers. The
  standalone spacecraft model viewer is stashed for now.
- **Rocky surfaces rebuilt** around a shared Luna recipe — broad tonal regions,
  craters at five scales laid largest-first, and a real bump map so relief
  catches the light. Replaces the flat, uniformly-pitted look.
- The telemetry ticker scrolls again regardless of the system's reduce-motion
  setting; stopping it hid readings rather than just calming the page.
- Small bodies no longer participate in shadow mapping, which was darkening
  them to near-black for nothing.

## 1.3.0

- Milky Way sphere dropped on phones; desktop gets the full 8K map back.
- Halley's coma shells removed and its nucleus held still while focused.
- Mobile re-centres a focused object once the detail sheet is collapsed.
- Category tabs centre on wide windows instead of packing to the left.

## 1.2.0

Launch readiness: adaptive rendering, tests, and accessibility.

- **Per-device quality tiers.** Texture set, canvas pixel budget, shadows, belt
  density and geometry detail now scale with the device. Mobile texture memory
  fell from ~395 MB (past what mobile Safari will allocate) to ~35 MB, and the
  iPhone payload from 28.9 MB to 7.2 MB.
- **Test suite** — 125 tests over the render-loop arithmetic, orbital maths,
  catalog integrity, quality tiers and components, plus CI running lint, tests,
  build and an asset budget on every push.
- The catalog is reachable on a phone: the category bar no longer hides behind
  a scroll gesture the canvas swallows.
- Hidden controls are `inert`, so keyboard users no longer tab through 13
  invisible category buttons.
- Deep links (`/object/…`, `/satellites`) load instead of 404ing.
- A top-level error boundary, and recovery from WebGL context loss.

## 1.1.0

Content and correctness.

- Painted surfaces for the 25 bodies with no photographic map, drawn from each
  one's real characteristics; six "textures" turned out to be saved 404 pages.
- Curated, load-verified NASA imagery for 55 objects, replacing a live search
  that returned photos of people at NASA HQ for "Mars".
- A real ISS tracker: live position on a 3D globe with ground track and a true
  day/night terminator.
- Procedural spacecraft models, replacing `.glb` files that were never shipped.
- Assets cut from 212 MB to 21 MB on first load.

## 1.0.0

First release considered complete: the 3D solar system, the object catalog,
search, and detail views.

### Earlier

Development builds `0.1.x`–`0.3.0`, before the versioning convention above was
settled. Notable: `0.2.2` fixed moons disappearing until a reload, `0.2.4`
added Halley's Comet, `0.3.0` was the first performance and mobile pass.
